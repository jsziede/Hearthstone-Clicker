#Hearthstone Clicker
A simple clicker game based on the card game Hearthstone as a dedication to a couple of my friends. I am creating this game as a means to learn and teach myself the basics of JavaScript.

###Current State of the Project
This project is, for the most part, almost finished. Some more tweaks to the CSS need to be made and user options still need to be added, but you are able to go from start to finish with the game.
