#Hearthstone Clicker
A simple clicker game based on the card game Hearthstone as a dedication to a couple of my friends. I am creating this game as a means to learn and teach myself the basics of JavaScript.

###Current State of the Project
The CSS and HTML still has a lot of work to do, with the random green borders acting as placeholders. Most of the essential JavaScript has been created but there are still a few tweaks to do and a couple more features to add, such as upgrading the accumulator and multipliers, along with changing the enemy and setting.
